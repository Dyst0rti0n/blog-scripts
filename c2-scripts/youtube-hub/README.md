# YouTube C2 Hub
This project demonstrates how to use YouTube as a Command and Control (C2) server by embedding commands within video descriptions or comments. This approach leverages the widespread use of YouTube to blend C2 traffic with regular web traffic, making it less likely to be detected.

## Why YouTube?
- **Publicly Accessible**: Easily accessible and free.
- **High Traffic**: Blends in with regular traffic.
- **Dynamic Content**: Regular updates and high engagement.

## Setting Up
1. **Create a YouTube Channel**
Use an anonymous or nondescript name for your YouTube channel to maintain anonymity.

2. **Upload Videos**
Include commands in video descriptions or comments. For example, you could add a command like `execute task1` in the description of your latest video.

3. **Fetch Commands**
Use the YouTube API to parse the descriptions and retrieve the commands.

## Example: Fetching Commands from YouTube Descriptions
### Prerequisites
1. **Google API Client Library for Python**:
Install the library using pip:

```sh
pip install google-api-python-client
```

2. **YouTube API Key**:
Obtain a YouTube API key from the Google Cloud Console.

## Usage
1. **Replace `YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY` with your actual YouTube API key**.
2. Replace `YOUR_YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID` with your actual YouTube channel ID.
3. Run the script to fetch the latest command from your YouTube channel's video descriptions:
```sh
python example.py
```

## Advanced Usage
- **Embedding Encrypted Commands**: For added security, you can encrypt commands before embedding them in video descriptions. The script can then decrypt the commands after fetching them.
- **Error Handling**: Implement additional error handling to manage API rate limits and network issues.
